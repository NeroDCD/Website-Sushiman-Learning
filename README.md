# Project Overview

This project was created following the YouTube tutorial titled **"Creating a Sushi-Themed Website: 2023 HTML & CSS Guide for Beginners."** The tutorial offers a detailed walkthrough of constructing a fully responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The tutorial not only focuses on building the layout but also introduces the `BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology` , which is covered in depth. This methodology is essential for maintaining organized and scalable CSS code, ensuring that the website is both well-structured and easy to maintain. The tutorial provides practical insights into best practices for web development, making it a valuable resource for both beginners and those looking to refine their skills.

This tutorial helped me grasp the following concepts:
- Setting up a project using Vite
- Understanding how Vite organizes and manages files in a basic setup
- Implementing the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology

**Note:** I customized a few aspects of the project based on my preferences:

- Adjusted the primary color of the landing page
- Replaced the background with my own assets
- Added custom hover effects



These changes were made to enhance my understanding and improve the overall design of the project.
